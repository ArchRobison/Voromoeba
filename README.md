# About the Code

Some of this code dates back to the late '90s, predating even C++98,
and some has been updated to C++14, so it has a mix of styles. Compilers 
were slower in earlier times, so effort was made to avoid including large 
headers such as <algorithm>. That's no longer a big issue.

## Modules

To represent a module, the code uses a class with all static members.
This should not be confused with C++20 modules.

## Names

Namespace scope names are generally in PascalCase. Othernames in camelCase. Constants are sometimes in SNAKE_CASE.
